## 2026-05-09 - Cluster reshape + LLM routing overhaul

What was done:

- Rebuilt gridz4 Blackwell (RTX PRO 4000 24GB) with CUDA [[llama.cpp]] (sm_120). Deployed Qwen3.6-35B-A3B Claude-Opus-Reasoning-Distilled at ~145 tok/sec. Promoted gridz4 to ORACLE primary in `llm/router.py` and updated `LLM_ORACLE_PROVIDER=llamacpp_z4` in `.env`. Updated systemd unit `/etc/systemd/system/z4-llama.service` to source `LLAMA_BIN` from `/etc/default/z4-llama`; kept Vulkan binary as rollback.
- Upgraded panda [[Ollama]]: `qwen2.5:32b` → `qwen3.6:27b-q4_K_M`. Purged old qwen2.5 models (38GB freed; /home: 13G → 31G free). GPU 0 already pinned.
- Expanded ocr-node (2× 8GB Ampere): set up `anikd` SSH user with key auth, grew LVM disk from 100GB → 462GB using `lvextend +100%FREE`, wiped SATA drive and mounted as `/scratch` ext4 (110GB), successfully pulled `gemma3:12b-it-q4_K_M` after restart.
- Provisioned koala (2× GTX TITAN X Maxwell 12GB sm_5.2): Card 0 = [[Ollama]] with `gemma3:12b-it-q4_K_M` + `nomic-embed-text`; Card 1 = Whisper service (whisper.cpp, :8092) + Kokoro TTS (CPU, :8091). Round-trip voice test passed.
- Demoted grid-svr ORACLE to fallback. Wired new providers (`ollama_panda`, `ollama_ocr`, `ollama_koala`) into `llm/router.py` with defaults in `config.py`. Restarted all services (grid-hermes, grid-intelligence, grid-extractor, grid-api) to pick up new environment. PR #104 (+106 lines).

Non-obvious decisions:

- Promoted gridz4 as ORACLE primary despite being a remote node: Blackwell + 35B-A3B distill outperform grid-svr's Pascal + 27B at 3–5× speed with comparable output quality, justifying the latency trade-off for long-horizon reasoning tasks.
- Kept Vulkan [[llama.cpp]] binary as rollback instead of deletion in case future CUDA auto-updates cause issues.
- Pinned koala Card 1 to CPU for both Whisper and Kokoro rather than splitting GPU: Whisper.cpp Vulkan is lightweight, and TTS can comfortably run CPU; reserves GPU for future workloads.

Broken or TBD:

- grid-api and grid-hermes may need router chain tuning if fallback to grid-svr ORACLE becomes frequent; monitor response times.
- No load-balancing metrics instrumented yet for the new provider chain; consider adding Prometheus metrics for llm/router.py provider selection.
- ocr-node `/scratch` mount is ext4 on SATA; consider upgrading to faster media if I/O becomes a bottleneck.

Next pick-up:

- Monitor gridz4 z4-llama.service uptime and error logs over 24h; verify no CUDA memory exhaustion or timeout issues.
- Instrument llm/router.py with provider selection metrics (Prometheus counters per provider).
- If panda qwen3.6 proves stable, retire qwen2.5 binary entirely and reclaim additional [[Ollama]] disk space.
- Benchmark koala Whisper + Kokoro latency with grid-api in production load; consider GPU acceleration if CPU bottleneck emerges.
