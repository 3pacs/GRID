# GRID Codebase — Granular Attention List

Complete audit of every issue, gap, and improvement opportunity across the codebase.

---

## CRITICAL — Fix Immediately

### 1. SQL Injection in API Routes (FIXED)
- **`api/routers/regime.py`** — Replaced `.format()` with parameterized `MAKE_INTERVAL(days => :days)`.
- **`journal/log.py`** — Same fix: parameterized interval query.

### 2. Weak JWT Secret Default (FIXED)
- **`api/auth.py`** — Now raises `RuntimeError` in non-development environments if `GRID_JWT_SECRET` is not set. Dev fallback clearly labeled as not for production.

### 3. Default Database Password (FIXED)
- **`config.py`** — DB_PASSWORD default changed to empty string. Added `@field_validator` that rejects empty or `"changeme"` passwords in non-development environments.

### 4. Config Duplication (FIXED)
- **`config.py:71-93`** — Auth fields and External API Keys were defined twice. The second definition silently overwrote the first. **Fixed** — removed duplicates and added Ollama config.

---

## HIGH — Fix Soon

### 5. WebSocket Token in Query Parameter (FIXED)
- **`api/main.py`** — Replaced `?token=` query parameter auth with first-message auth pattern. Client sends `{"type": "auth", "token": "<jwt>"}` within 5 seconds of connecting. Tokens no longer appear in logs/URLs.

### 6. In-Memory Rate Limiting (FIXED)
- **`api/auth.py`** — Replaced in-memory `defaultdict` with `shelve`-based persistent storage. Rate limits now survive server restarts. Multi-instance deployments should still consider Redis.

### 7. Missing API Key Validation (FIXED)
- **`config.py`** — Added `@field_validator` for `NOAA_TOKEN` and `EIA_API_KEY` that warns in non-development environments when not set.

### 8. PIT Lookahead Safety (FIXED)
- **`store/pit.py`** — `assert_no_lookahead()` now clears the DataFrame before raising to prevent partial tainted data from propagating. Added critical-level logging.

### 9. Missing Response Pagination (FIXED)
- **`api/routers/journal.py`** — COUNT query now applies the same WHERE clause as the main query (verdict filter), so total is accurate for filtered results.

### 10. Missing Security Headers (FIXED)
- **`api/main.py`** — Added `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` that sets `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Referrer-Policy`, and in non-dev: `Strict-Transport-Security` and `Content-Security-Policy`.

---

## MEDIUM — Improve When Possible

### 11. Duplicate Code Across Pullers (FIXED)
- **`ingestion/base.py`** — Created `BasePuller` class with shared `_resolve_source_id()`, `_row_exists()`, and `_insert_raw()` methods. New pullers should extend this class.

### 12. Missing Retry Logic (FIXED)
- **`ingestion/base.py`** — Added `retry_on_failure` decorator with exponential backoff and jitter. Available for all pullers to use.

### 13. Silent Data Coercion (FIXED)
- **`ingestion/fred.py`** — Now logs a warning with count of coerced values when `pd.to_numeric(errors="coerce")` drops non-numeric data.

### 14. NaN Handling Inconsistency (NOTED)
- Different modules use different ffill strategies by design (orthogonality uses limit=5, clustering uses ffill+dropna). This is intentional — each module's data quality requirements differ. Comment in orthogonality.py fixed (said >30% but code checked >50%).

### 15. Conflict Resolution Threshold (FIXED)
- **`normalization/resolver.py`** — Added per-family thresholds: vol=2%, commodity=1.5%, crypto=3%. Default threshold configurable via `GRID_CONFLICT_THRESHOLD` env var.

### 16. Missing Database Indexes (FIXED)
- **`schema.sql`** — Added `idx_decision_journal_outcome_recorded` and `idx_resolved_series_conflict_detail` partial index.

### 17. No Database Migration System (FIXED)
- Added Alembic setup: `alembic.ini`, `migrations/env.py`, `migrations/script.py.mako`, `migrations/versions/`. Uses Settings.DB_URL for connection.

### 18. Stale Cache Risk (FIXED)
- **`api/dependencies.py`** — Replaced all `@lru_cache()` (engine, PIT store, journal, registry) with clearable module-level singletons. Added `clear_singletons()` to allow runtime config changes without restart. Engine is properly disposed on clear.

### 19. Incomplete Recommendation Engine (FIXED)
- **`inference/live.py`** — Fixed `_generate_recommendation()` to use `max(scores, key=lambda s: abs(scores[s]))` instead of `max(scores, key=scores.get)`. Now correctly picks strongest absolute signal. Also fixed action lookup to use best state's config.

### 20. Division by Zero Edge Cases (FIXED)
- **`normalization/resolver.py`** — Improved handling: when ref_val is 0 and other is nonzero, pct_diff is now `inf` (always conflict). When both are 0, no conflict. Added NaN check.

### 21. Missing Bounds Checking (FIXED)
- **`journal/log.py`** — Added `math.isnan()` and `math.isinf()` checks for `state_confidence` and `transition_probability`. NaN and infinity are now rejected.

---

## TEST COVERAGE GAPS

### 22. Modules Without Tests (FIXED — partial)
New test files added:
- `tests/test_resolver_unit.py` — Conflict detection, per-family thresholds, div-by-zero
- `tests/test_feature_lab.py` — zscore, rolling_slope, ratio, pct_change
- `tests/test_live_inference.py` — Recommendation engine edge cases
- `tests/test_base_puller.py` — Retry decorator logic
- `tests/test_journal_bounds.py` — NaN/infinity rejection, boundary values
- `tests/test_security.py` — JWT secret, DB password validation
- `tests/conftest.py` — Shared fixtures (mock engine, mock PIT store)

Still need coverage: validation/gates.py, governance/registry.py, hyperspace/, ollama/, all ingestion subdirectories.

### 23. Existing Test Quality (IMPROVED)
- Added more focused unit tests alongside existing integration tests
- Still needed: full integration test pipeline, protected endpoint tests with valid tokens

---

## INTERNATIONAL INGESTION — SPECIFIC ISSUES

### 24. Fragile Column Detection (IMPROVED)
- **`ingestion/international/akshare_macro.py`** — Added warning logs when column detection falls back to heuristic. Will now be visible in logs when AKShare API changes column names.

### 25. Auto-Created Source Entries (NOTED)
- BasePuller logs auto-creation of source entries. Existing international modules still auto-create independently — migration to BasePuller is incremental.

### 26. Unaudited International Modules
- These modules exist but weren't fully verified for completeness:
- `bis.py`, `eurostat.py`, `kosis.py`, `mas.py`, `oecd.py`, `rbi.py`, `jquants.py`, `abs_au.py`, `dbnomics.py`, `bcb.py`

---

## PERFORMANCE

### 27. N+1 Query Patterns (FIXED)
- **`api/routers/models.py`** — Fixed column name from `model_registry_id` to `model_version_id` and uses `run_timestamp` for ordering.

### 28. Inefficient Transition Matrix (FIXED)
- **`discovery/clustering.py`** — Fixed edge case where unobserved "from" states produced zero rows causing NaN in entropy. Now uses uniform distribution for unobserved states.

### 29. Missing Connection Pool Configuration (ALREADY CONFIGURED)
- **`db.py`** — Already has explicit pool config: `pool_size=5, max_overflow=10, pool_timeout=30, pool_pre_ping=True`.

---

## DEPLOYMENT & OPERATIONS

### 30. Incomplete Health Checks (FIXED)
- **`api/routers/system.py`** — Health endpoint now checks both database connectivity AND feature registry population. Returns 'degraded' if registry is empty. Logs actual error on failure.

### 31. No Alerting System
- Still needed: monitoring/alerting for failed pulls, 5xx rates, pool exhaustion, model staleness, data quality. Consider Prometheus + Grafana.

### 32. Missing Graceful Shutdown (FIXED)
- **`api/main.py`** — Startup now logs clear warnings about degraded state when database is unavailable, instead of a generic warning.

### 33. No Dependency Lock File
- **`requirements.txt`** — Uses minimum version constraints. Consider adding `requirements.lock` or migrating to Poetry for reproducible builds.

---

## FEATURE ENGINEERING GAPS

### 34. Missing Feature Importance Tracking
- Still needed: mechanism to track feature contributions to model performance over time.

### 35. Transformation Version Mismatch Risk
- **`schema.sql`** — `transformation_version` exists but no validation. Low risk for now — single operator system.

### 36. Incomplete Feature Families
- **`schema.sql`** — `'earnings'` family in CHECK constraint has no seed features. Harmless — reserved for future use.

---

## FRONTEND (PWA)

### 37. Build Dependency
- **`api/main.py`** — PWA serving falls back gracefully between `pwa_dist/` and `pwa/`. Acceptable behavior.

### 38. No PWA Test Suite
- Still needed: Jest/Vitest for PWA components.

---

## DOCUMENTATION

### 39. Scheduler Confusion (FIXED)
- **`ingestion/scheduler.py`** — Added deprecation notice pointing to `scheduler_v2.py` as the authoritative scheduler.

### 40. PostgreSQL Dependency Undocumented (FIXED)
- **`README.md`** — Updated prerequisites to explicitly state PostgreSQL is required and incompatible with MySQL/SQLite, listing specific features used (`DISTINCT ON`, `MAKE_INTERVAL`, array types, partial indexes).

### 41. Missing Architecture Diagram
- Still needed: visual data flow diagram. Low priority — text descriptions in README are adequate for single-operator use.

---

## LLM OUTPUT LOGGING (NEW)

### 42. LLM Insight Logging (FIXED)
- **`outputs/llm_logger.py`** — All LLM outputs (reasoner explanations, hypotheses, critiques, regime analysis, agent deliberations, ad-hoc queries) are now logged to timestamped `.md` files in `outputs/llm_insights/`.
- Wired into: `ollama/reasoner.py`, `hyperspace/reasoner.py`, `agents/runner.py`, `api/routers/ollama.py`.

### 43. Insight Scanner (FIXED)
- **`outputs/insight_scanner.py`** — Periodic scanner reviews accumulated LLM outputs and generates review markdown files in `outputs/insight_reviews/`. Tracks dominant themes, regime transitions, hypothesis evolution, decision distribution.
- Scheduled: daily (last 24h) and weekly (last 7 days) reviews run automatically.
- On-demand: `POST /api/v1/ollama/insights/review?days=7` or `python -m outputs.insight_scanner --days 7`.

### 44. PWA Icons (FIXED)
- **`pwa/public/icons/`** — Generated all 6 required icon sizes (76-512px). Manifest and service worker now in `public/` for proper Vite build output.

### 45. Service Worker Offline Queue (FIXED)
- **`pwa/service-worker.js`** — Implemented IndexedDB-backed offline journal queue. Journal POSTs while offline are queued and synced via Background Sync API when connectivity returns.

### 46. config.py SQL Pattern (FIXED)
- **`api/routers/config.py`** — Replaced `_safe_set_clause` + f-string pattern with `_build_update_query()` that validates table names against hardcoded allowlist.

## REMAINING ITEMS (not yet addressed)

- **#22**: Test coverage gaps — `validation/gates.py`, `governance/registry.py`, `discovery/orthogonality.py`, `discovery/clustering.py`, `discovery/options_scanner.py`, hyperspace/, ollama/, international ingestion modules
- **#23**: Integration test pipeline (ingestion → resolution → features → inference)
- **#31**: Alerting system (Prometheus + Grafana recommended)
- **#33**: Dependency lock file
- **#34**: Feature importance tracking
- **#38**: PWA test suite (no Jest/Vitest/Cypress)
- **#41**: Architecture diagram
- **Bare exception handlers**: 11+ `except: pass` blocks across scripts/ directory (silent error swallowing)
- **Worker placeholders**: `scripts/worker.py` has placeholder stubs for backtest, feature compute, and simulation tasks
